		<br><b>C++ Project:</b> Take user input using several different html  input types and be able to correctly display it back to the user. Will calculate 
		<br>users age and compare it to the inputted birthday to make sure that they are the correct age. Another function of the code is that it will 
		<br>intake a string from the user and correctly display the ASCII value of each character and also display the amount of times that character
		<br>appears in the string. The page will also diaply errors for missing values and incorrect values (such as age = “dog”)  
		<br>
		<br><b>MySQL Database Project:</b> Connected to a MySQL Database and the page allows you to view all the customer names in the database.
		<br>You are also able to view another database that stores information on products, you can view specific products or all the products in the
		<br>database. This project allows you to log into the page using the customers login information. The information to the different accounts can
		<br>be found on the Projects page. Once logged in you are able to logout, order a product from the products database, view a previous order,
		<br>change the order, or cancel your order.
