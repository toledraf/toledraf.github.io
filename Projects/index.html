			<b>the selected courses, the township you select, and will take in the input string and display 
			<b>the ASCII number of each character and count how many times that character appeared in the 
			<b>string. Will also display the character(s) with the maximum count and the character(s) with 
			<b>the minimum count. The page will also display errors such as if your age does not match your 
			<b>birthday, or if input values are missing or incorrect (like age value is "dog").
